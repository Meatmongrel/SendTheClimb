# SendTheClimb
<h3>The app that helps you find your next project!</h3>
https://send-the-climb.firebaseapp.com/
This app I made in a week finds nearby climbs relative to Flatiron School's (The Hub 3601 Walnut St, Denver, CO 80205) location.
<br>
There were features I wanted to impliment before this week was up, but wasn't able to due to time constraints. I challenged myself to make it purely front end, although originally users were planned for the project the idea was ultimately scrapped.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A web browser</li>  
</ul>
This is a purely front-end app that makes calls to a couple APIs. I deployed the app to firebase for easy use.
<h2>Usage</h2>
The app is very simple. The home page automatically gives you climbs within 10 miles, theres a search page where you can see a lot more. The search form allows for a range of 50 miles max and can show both climbs in the trad/sport category, as well as boulders.
